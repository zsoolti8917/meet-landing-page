## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor


### What I learned


I had a great time working on this project. It significantly expanded my understanding of background images, and I got to experiment with flex-basis for sizing images within a flex container. Additionally, I delved deeper into SASS, which I found really enjoyable and intend to utilize more in future projects.

### Continued development

I dont plan to continoue to work on this project
